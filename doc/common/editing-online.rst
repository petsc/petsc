We welcome corrections for our documentation. You can submit corrections to petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov or `post an issue <https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/issues>`_.  Add the label ``docs``. Also add ``docs-only`` in the typical case where the only changes are to documentation.

Or you can supply corrections to PETSc document directly when viewing it online. Click "edit this page".
Once you have edited the document, at the bottom of the page, type a summary of your
changes in the ``Commit Message`` box, type a unique branch name in ``Target Branch`` box, and press ``Commit Changes``.
On the resulting Merge Commit page select the ``Labels`` ``Workflow:Review`` and ``docs-only`` then press  ``Submit``. The following movie demonstrates the needed steps - note that the first step is outdated.
