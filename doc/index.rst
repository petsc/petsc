PETSc |version|
===============
PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation,
pronounced PET-see (`/ˈpɛt-siː/ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English#Key>`__), is
for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific
applications modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs). It has bindings for C, Fortran, and Python (via petsc4py).
PETSc also contains TAO, the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization, software library.
It supports MPI, and GPUs through
CUDA, HIP, Kokkos, or OpenCL, as well as hybrid MPI-GPU parallelism; it also supports the NEC-SX Tsubasa Vector Engine.
Immediately jump in and run PETSc code :any:`handson`.

PETSc is developed as :ref:`open-source <doc_license>`, :any:`requests <doc_creepycrawly>` and :any:`contributions <ch_contributing>` are welcome.

.. admonition:: News: Mrs Hong Zhang, who has been a PETSc developer for twenty-five years and mentored many students and future PETSc developers, has retired.
