Changes
-------
(See `Features`_ below)

   .. rubric:: General:

   -  Simpler interface for structured grids, see
      src/snes/examples/tutorials/ex5.c
   -  "System routines" including PLog..., Options..., Viewer...,
      Draw...., FList...,OList... now all begin with the string Petsc.
      For example, PetscOptionsGetInt() and PetscLogBegin().
   -  The calling sequence for PetscMalloc() was changed to return and
      error code and deliver the pointer as a new final argument. Due to
      this change, the macros CHKPTRA() and CHKPTRQ() were dropped.

   .. rubric:: AO (Application Orderings):

   .. rubric:: TS (Timestepping Solvers):

   .. rubric:: SNES (Nonlinear Solvers):

   .. rubric:: SLES (Linear Solvers):

   .. rubric:: KSP (Krylov Subspace Methods):

   .. rubric:: PC (Preconditioners):

   .. rubric:: MAT (Matrices):

   -  When using MatCreate(), you must follow with a MatSetType() or
      MatSetFromOptions() before using the matrix.
   -  Changed
      ``int             MatShellSetOperation(Mat,MatOperation,void*);``
      to
      ``int             MatShellSetOperation(Mat,MatOperation,void(*)());``
   -  Changed
      ``int             MatShellGetOperation(Mat,MatOperation,void**);``
      to
      ``int             MatShellGetOperation(Mat,MatOperation,void(**)());``
   -  Changed IncompleteCholesky to ICC

   .. rubric:: DA (Distributed Arrays):

   -  Changed the DAMG routines to DMMG routines.
   -  DAGetColoring() now has new second argument that takes either
      IS_COLORING_GLOBAL or IS_COLOR_GLOBAL and a new third argument
      that takes the matrix type of either MATMPIAIJ or MATMPIBAIJ.

   .. rubric:: VEC (Vectors):

   -  Changed ``int VecSetOperation(Vec,VecOperation,void*);`` to
      ``int VecSetOperation(Vec,VecOperation,void(*)());``

   .. rubric:: IS (Index Sets):

   .. rubric:: General:

   .. rubric:: Draw (Graphics):

   .. rubric:: Viewers:

   .. rubric:: System:

   .. rubric:: Error Handling:

   -  CHKERRA() is now obselete; use CHKERRQ() instead. Changed the
      calling sequence of SETERRQ() to eliminate the second input
      parameter.

   .. rubric:: Event Logging:

   .. rubric:: Fortran Interface:


Features
--------
(See `Changes`_ above)

   .. rubric:: General:

   -  Simpler interface for structured grids, see
      src/snes/examples/tutorials/ex5.c
   -  Complete infrastructure for parallel multigrid for linear and
      nonlinear problems on structured grids. See
      src/snes/examples/tutorials/ex19.c
   -  Added manual pages for PETSc objects, enums etc.
   -  Added html version of all source code and examples, accessible
      from docs/index.html and the manual pages.

   .. rubric:: AO (Application Orderings):

   .. rubric:: TS (Timestepping Solvers):

   .. rubric:: SNES (Nonlinear Solvers):

   .. rubric:: SLES (Linear Solvers):

   .. rubric:: KSP (Krylov Subspace Methods):

   -  Added support for "diagonal scaling" of preconditioned system as
      required by most ODE integrators via PCDiagonalScaleSet().

   .. rubric:: PC (Preconditioners):

   .. rubric:: MAT (Matrices):

   -  Added the Henry Tufo/Paul Fischer libtfs scalable parallel direct
      solver for MPIAIJ matrices.
   -  Added routine MatFDColoringSetRecompute().
