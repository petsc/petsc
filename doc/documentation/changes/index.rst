Changes
=======

We will continually add new features and enhanced functionality in
upcoming releases; **small changes in usage and calling sequences of
PETSc routines will continue to occur**. Although keeping one's code
accordingly up-to-date can be annoying, all PETSc users will be
rewarded in the long run with a cleaner, better designed, and
easier-to-use interface.

We suggest that users who want to upgrade their current PETSc
application codes from a particular version to the most recent
release proceed through the changes listed in this file in increasing
order of version numbers. (Note: One can determine the release number
of any current PETSc installation by looking in the file
include/petscversion.h) Many of the interface changes can be handled
quickly and easily by using global replacement via your favorite text
editor. See the file
:doc:`/miscellaneous/codemanagement` for
some tips that we find helpful in keeping our own code up to date and
that should be generally useful for effective code management.
