\chapter{Getting Started}
\label{chapter:intro_tao}

TAO can be used on a personal
computer with a single processor or within a parallel environment.  
Its basic usage involves only a few commands, but fully 
understanding its usage requires time.
Application programmers can easily begin to use TAO by working with 
some examples provides in the package
and then gradually learn more details according to
their needs.  The current version of TAO and the most recent help 
concerning the installation and usage of TAO can be found at  
\url{http://www.mcs.anl.gov/tao/}.

The current version (1.10.1) of TAO requires an ANSI C++ compiler, 
an implementation of MPI, Version 3.1 of PETSc compiled with the C++ 
compiler, (PETSc must be configured with the \texttt{--with-clanguage=C++}
option) and at 
least 15 MB of free disk space.
During the setup process, the user will have to set an environmental
variable, \texttt{TAO\_DIR}\findex{TAO_DIR}, indicating the full path of 
the TAO home directory.
This variable will be used in this
manual to refer to the location of files, and by computers that
will compile TAO source code.

\section{Writing Application Codes with TAO}

The examples throughout the library demonstrate the software usage and
can serve as templates for developing custom applications.  We suggest
that new TAO users examine programs in
\begin{verbatim}
   ${TAO_DIR}/src/examples .
\end{verbatim} % Needed to fool the xemacs coloring algorithm $
\noindent
Additional examples are available on our website and in
\begin{verbatim}
   ${TAO_DIR}/src/<unconstrained,bound,..>/examples/tutorials,
\end{verbatim} 
% $
\noindent
where \texttt{<component>}
denotes any of the TAO components, such as 
\texttt{bound} or \texttt{unconstrained}.
The HTML version of the manual pages located at
\begin{verbatim}
   ${TAO_DIR}/docs/manpages/index.html
\end{verbatim} % To fool the coloring algorithm $
\noindent
or
\begin{verbatim}
   http://www.mcs.anl.gov/tao/documentation/manpages/index.html
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
provides indices (organized by both routine names and concepts) to the
tutorial examples.

We suggest the following procedure for writing a new application
program using TAO:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Install TAO according to the instructions in
  \url{http://www.mcs.anl.gov/tao/documentation/index.html}.
\item Copy the examples and makefile from the directory
  \url{${TAO\_DIR}/examples/}, compile the examples, and run the
  programs.
\item Select the example program matching the application most
  closely, and use it as a starting point for developing a customized
  code.
\end{enumerate}

\section{A Simple TAO Example}
\label{sec:simple}

To help the user start using TAO immediately, we use a simple
uniprocessor example. The code in
Figure~\ref{fig:example1} is for minimizing the
extended Rosenbrock function $f: \Re^n \to \Re$ defined by
\[
 f(x) = 
 \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \left( \alpha(x_{2i+1}-x_{2i}^2)^2 + (1-x_{2i})^2 \right),
\]
where $n = 2m$ is the number of variables.  The code in
Figure~\ref{fig:example1} is only the main program.  We have not
included the code for evaluating the function and gradient or
for evaluating the Hessian matrix.

\afterpage{
\begin{figure}[H]
  {\footnotesize \verbatiminput{rosenbrock1.c}}
\caption{Example of Uniprocessor TAO Code\label{fig:example1}}
\end{figure}
}

Note that while we use the C language to introduce the TAO software,
the package is also fully usable from C++ and Fortran77/90.
Section~\ref{chapter:petscfapp} discusses additional issues concerning
Fortran usage.

The code in Figure~\ref{fig:example1} contains many of the components
needed to write most TAO programs and thus, is illustrative of the
features present in complex optimization problems.  Note that we have
omitted the code required for the routine \texttt{FormFunctionGradient},
which evaluates the function and gradient, and the code for
\texttt{FormHessian}, which evaluates the Hessian matrix for Rosenbrock's
function.  The following sections annotates the lines of code in
Figure~\ref{fig:example1}.

\section{Include Files}

The C++ include file for TAO should be used via the statement
\begin{verbatim}
   #include "tao.h"
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
The required lower level include files are automatically included
within this high-level file.

\section{TAO Initialization}
\label{sec:initialization}

All TAO programs contain a call to \findex{TaoInitialize()}
\begin{verbatim}
   info = TaoInitialize(int *argc,char ***argv,char *file_name, 
                        char *help_message);
\end{verbatim}
\noindent 
This command initializes TAO (and also MPI and PETSc if these have not
yet been initialized elsewhere).  The arguments \texttt{argc} and
\texttt{argv} are the command line arguments delivered in all C and
C++ programs. \sindex{command line arguments} The argument
\texttt{file\_name} optionally indicates an alternative name for an
options file, which by default is called \texttt{.petscrc} and resides
in the user's home directory.  See the PETSc users manual for details
regarding runtime option specification.  The final argument,
\texttt{help\_message}, is an optional character string that will be
printed if the program is run with the \texttt{-help} option.

As illustrated by the \texttt{TaoInitialize()} statement above, TAO
routines return an integer indicating whether an error has occurred
during the call.  The error code is set to be nonzero if an error has
been detected; otherwise, it is zero.  For the C or C++ interface, the
error variable is the routine's return value, while for the Fortran
version, each TAO routine has as its final argument an integer error
variable.  Error tracebacks are discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:tao_programming}.

\section{TAO Finalization}

All TAO programs should call \texttt{TaoFinalize()}
\findex{TaoFinalize()} as their final (or nearly final) statement
\findex{TaoFinalize()}
\begin{verbatim}
   info = TaoFinalize();
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
This routine handles options to be called at the conclusion of the
program, and calls \texttt{PetscFinalize()} %\findex{PetscFinalize()}
if \texttt{TaoInitialize()} began PETSc. If PETSc was initiated
externally from TAO (by either the user or another software package),
the user is responsible for calling \texttt{PetscFinalize()}.

\section{TAO Solvers}

The primary commands for solving an unconstrained optimization problem
using TAO are shown in Figure \ref{fig:tao_commands}.
\findex{TaoCreate()} \findex{TaoApplicationCreate()} \findex{TaoSetObjectiveAndGradientRoutine()}
\findex{TaoSetHessianMat()} \findex{TaoSolveApplication()}
\findex{TaoDestroy()} \findex{TaoSetInitialSolutionVec()}
\findex{TaoSetHessianRoutine()} \findex{TaoSolveApplication()} 
\findex{TaoApplicationDestroy()}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{verbatim}
   TaoCreate(MPI_Comm comm, TaoMethod method, TAO_SOLVER *tao); 
   TaoApplicationCreate(MPI_Comm comm, TAO_APPLICATION *taoapp); 
   TaoSetInitialSolutionVec(TAO_APPLICATION taoapp, Vec x);
   TaoSetObjectiveAndGradientRoutine(TAO_APPLICATION taoapp,
            int (*FormFGradient)(TAO_APPLICATION,Vec,double,Vec,void*),void *user);
   TaoSetHessianMat(TAO_APPLICATION taoapp, Mat H, Mat Hpre);
   TaoSetHessianRoutine(TAO_APPLICATION taoapp,
            int (*Hessian)(TAO_APPLICATION, Vec, Mat*, Mat*, MatStructure*, void*),(void *)&user);
   TaoSolveApplication(TAO_APPLICATION taoapp, TAO_SOLVER tao);
   TaoApplicationDestroy(TAO_APPLICATION taoapp);
   TaoDestroy(TAO_SOLVER tao);
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Commands for solving an unconstrained optimization problem
\label{fig:tao_commands}}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The user first creates the \texttt{TAO\_SOLVER} and
\texttt{TAO\_APPLICATION} contexts. He then sets call-back routines as
well as vector (\texttt{Vec}) and matrix (\texttt{Mat}) data
structures that the TAO solver will use for evaluating the
minimization function, gradient, and optionally the Hessian matrix.
The user then solves the minimization problem, and finally destroys
the \texttt{TAO\_SOLVER} and \texttt{TAO\_APPLICATION} contexts.
Details of these commands are presented in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:tao_solver}.

Note that \texttt{TaoCreate()} enables the user to select the solution
method at runtime by using an options database.  Through this
database, the user not only can select a minimization method (e.g.,
limited-memory variable metric, conjugate gradient, Newton with line
search or trust region), but also can prescribe the convergence
tolerance, set various monitoring routines, indicate techniques for
linear systems solves, etc.  See Chapter~\ref{chapter:tao_solver} for more 
information on the solver methods available in TAO.

\section{Function Evaluations}

Users of TAO are required to provide routines that perform function
evaluations. Depending on the solver chosen, they may also have to
write routines that evaluate the gradient vector and Hessian matrix.

\section{TAO Programming with PETSc}
\label{sec:tao_programming}

\subsection*{Include Files}

Applications using the PETSc package for vectors, matrices, and linear
solvers should include the appropriate header files.  For example
\begin{verbatim}
   #include "petscksp.h"
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
includes the appropriate information for most TAO applications using PETSc.

\subsection*{The Options Database}
\label{sec:options}

The user can input control data at run time using an options database.
The command
\begin{verbatim}
   PetscOptionsGetInt(PETSC_NULL, "-n", &user.n, &flg);
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
checks whether
the user has provided a command line option to set the value of \texttt{
n}, the number of variables.  If so, the variable \texttt{n} is set
accordingly; otherwise, \texttt{n} remains unchanged. A complete
description of the options database may be found in the PETSc users
manual.

\subsection*{Vectors}

In the example in Figure \ref{fig:example1}, the vector data structure
(\texttt{Vec}) is used to store the solution and gradient for TAO
unconstrained minimization solvers.  A new parallel or sequential
vector \texttt{x} of global dimension \texttt{M} is created with the
command % \findex{VecCreate()} \sindex{vectors}
\begin{verbatim}
   info = VecCreate(MPI_Comm comm,int m,int M,Vec *x);
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
where \texttt{comm} denotes the MPI communicator. The type of storage
for the vector may be set with either calls to \texttt{VecSetType()}
or \texttt{VecSetFromOptions()}.  Additional vectors of the same type
can be formed with % \findex{VecSetType()} \findex{VecSetFromOptions} \findex{VecDuplicate()}
\begin{verbatim}
   info = VecDuplicate(Vec old,Vec *new);
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
The commands % \findex{VecSet()} \findex{VecSetValues()}
\begin{verbatim}
   info = VecSet(Vec X,PetscScalar value);
   info = VecSetValues(Vec x,int n,int *indices,
                       Scalar *values,INSERT_VALUES);
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
respectively set all the components of a vector to a particular scalar
value and assign a different value to each component.  More detailed
information about PETSc vectors, including their basic operations,
scattering/gathering, index sets, and distributed arrays, may be found
in the PETSc users manual.

\subsection*{Matrices}

Usage of matrices and vectors is similar. \sindex{matrix} 
The user can create a new parallel or sequential matrix \texttt{H} with 
\texttt{M} global rows and \texttt{N} global columns, with the routine
%\findex{MatCreate()}
\begin{verbatim}
   info = MatCreate(MPI_Comm comm,int m,int n,int M,int N,Mat *H);
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
where the matrix format can be specified at runtime.  The user could
alternatively specify each processes' number of local rows and columns
using \texttt{m} and \texttt{n}.  \texttt{H} can then be used to store
the Hessian matrix, as indicated by the above routine
\texttt{TaoSetHessianMat()}.  Matrix entries can then be set with the
command
\begin{verbatim}
   info = MatSetValues(Mat H,int m,int *im,int n,int *in,
                       Scalar *values,INSERT_VALUES);
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
After %\findex{MatSetValues()} 
all elements have been inserted into the
matrix, it must be processed with the pair of commands
%\findex{MatAssemblyBegin()} \findex{MatAssemblyEnd()}
\begin{verbatim}
   info = MatAssemblyBegin(Mat H,MAT_FINAL_ASSEMBLY);
   info = MatAssemblyEnd(Mat H,MAT_FINAL_ASSEMBLY);
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
The PETSc users manual discusses various matrix formats as
well as the details of some basic matrix manipulation routines.

\subsection*{Parallel Programming}

Since TAO uses the message-passing model for parallel programming and
employs MPI for all interprocessor communication, the user is free to
employ MPI routines as needed throughout an application code.
However, by default the user is shielded from many of the details of
message passing within TAO, since these are hidden within parallel
objects, such as vectors, matrices, and solvers.  In addition, TAO
users can interface to external tools, such as the generalized vector
scatters/gathers and distributed arrays within PETSc, to assist in the
management of parallel data.

%\sindex{collective operations} 
The user must specify a communicator
upon creation of any TAO objects (such as a vector, matrix, or solver)
to indicate the processors over which the object is to be distributed.
For example, some commands for matrix, vector, and solver creation
are:
\begin{verbatim}
   info = MatCreate(MPI_Comm comm,int m,int n,int M,int N,Mat *H);
   info = VecCreate(MPI_Comm comm,int m,int M,Vec *x);
   info = TaoCreate(MPI_Comm comm,TaoMethod method,TAO_SOLVER *tao); 
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
The creation routines are collective over all processors in the
communicator; thus, all processors in the communicator {\em must} call
the creation routine.  In addition, if a sequence of collective
routines is being used, the routines {\em must} be called in the same
order on each processor.

\section{Compiling and Running TAO}
\label{sec:running}

Compilation of the TAO numerical libraries and TAO application codes
requires three environmental variables to be set.  These three
variables, \texttt{TAO\_DIR}, \texttt{PETSC\_ARCH}, and \texttt{PETSC\_DIR},
are discussed more fully in the TAO installation instructions.

TAO uses a portable makefile system provided by the
PETSc~\cite{petsc-web-page,petsc-user-ref} library, which is discussed
further in Section~\ref{sec:makefiles}.  The TAO library can be
compiled with the command
\begin{verbatim}
   make
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
from the \texttt{TAO\_DIR} directory.  

Running a TAO application on a single processor can be done in the
usual way by entering the name of the executable and any command line
options.  Running programs in parallel, however, requires use of the
MPI library.  All TAO programs use the MPI (Message Passing Interface)
standard for message-passing communication \cite{MPI-final}.  Thus, to
execute TAO programs, users must know the procedure for beginning MPI
jobs on their selected computer system(s).  For instance, when using
the MPICH implementation of MPI \cite{mpich-web-page} and many others,
the following command initiates a program that uses eight processors:
%\findex{mpirun} \sindex{running TAO programs} 
\begin{verbatim}
  mpirun -np 8 tao_program_name tao_options
\end{verbatim}

\begin{comment}
  Figure~\ref{fig:exrun} illustrates compiling and running a TAO
  program using MPICH.  Note that different sites may have slightly
  different library and compiler names.
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
  Users who are experiencing difficulties linking TAO programs should
  refer to the troubleshooting guide via the TAO home page {\tt
    http://www.mcs.anl.gov/tao} or the source code given by the file
  \texttt{{TAO\_DIR}/docs/troubleshooting.html}.

\nobreak

\end{comment}


\section{Error Checking}

All TAO commands begin with the \texttt{Tao} prefix and return an
integer indicating whether an error has occurred during the call.  The
error code equals zero after the successful completion of the routine
and is set to a nonzero value if an error has been detected.  The
macro \texttt{CHKERRQ(info)} checks the value of \texttt{info} and calls an
error handler upon error detection.  \texttt{CHKERRQ()} should be used in
all subroutines to enable a complete error traceback.

In Figure \ref{fig:traceback} we indicate a traceback generated by
error detection within a sample program. The error occurred on line
1007 of the file \texttt{\$\{TAO\_DIR\}/src/interface/tao.c} in the
routine \texttt{TaoSetUp()} and was caused by nonconforming local lengths
of the parallel gradient and solution vectors, which must be
identically partitioned.  The \texttt{TaoSetUp()} routine was called from
the \texttt{TaoSolveApplication()} routine, which was in turn called on line 229 of
the \texttt{main()} routine in the program \texttt{ex2.c}.  The PETSc users
manual provides further details regarding error checking, including
information about the Fortran interface.

\begin{figure}[htb]
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
[ember] mpirun -np 2 ex2 -tao_lmvm

\end{verbatim}
}
\caption{Example of Error Traceback}
\label{fig:traceback}
\end{figure}

\noindent
When running the debugging version of the TAO software (PETSc configured 
with the \texttt{--with-debugging} option), checking is performed for 
memory corruption
(writing outside of array bounds, etc). The macros \texttt{CHKMEMQ} and
\texttt{CHKMEMA} can be called anywhere in the code to check the current
status of the memory for corruption.  By putting several (or many) of
these macros into an application code, one can usually track
down the code segment where corruption has occurred.

\section{Makefiles}
\label{sec:makefiles}

To manage code portability across a wide variety of UNIX systems, TAO
uses a makefile system that is part of the PETSc software.  This
section briefly discusses makefile usage from the perspective of
application programmers; see the ``makefiles'' chapter of the PETSc
users manual for additional details.

\subsection*{Compiling TAO Programs}

To make a program named \texttt{rosenbrock1}, one may use the command
\begin{verbatim}
   make PETSC_ARCH=arch rosenbrock1
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
which compiles a debugging or optimized version of the example and
automatically link the appropriate libraries.  The architecture, {\tt
  arch}, is one of \texttt{solaris, rs6000, IRIX, hpux}, etc. Note that
when using command line options with make (as illustrated above), one
must {\em not} place spaces on either side of the ``='' signs.  The
variable \texttt{PETSC\_ARCH} can also be set as an
environmental variable.

\subsection*{Sample Makefiles}

\begin{figure}[tbh]
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}   
       CFLAGS    = 
       FFLAGS    = 
       CPPFLAGS  =
       FPPFLAGS  =
       
       include ${TAO_DIR}/bmake/tao_common
   
       rosenbrock1: rosenbrock1.o tao_chkopts
            -${CLINKER} -o rosenbrock1 rosenbrock1.o ${TAO_LIB} ${PETSC_SNES_LIB}
            ${RM} rosenbrock1.o
\end{verbatim} 
% $
}
\caption{Sample TAO Makefile for a Single Program}
\label{fig:make1}
\end{figure}

Maintaining portable TAO makefiles is very simple.  Figure
\ref{fig:make1} presents a minimal makefile for maintaining a single
program that uses the TAO library.  The most important line in this
makefile is the line starting with \texttt{include}:
\begin{verbatim}
   include ${TAO_DIR}/bmake/tao_common
\end{verbatim} 
% $
\noindent
\findex{TAO_LIB} This line includes other makefiles that provide the
needed definitions and rules for the particular base software
installations (specified by \texttt{\$\{TAO\_DIR\}} and {\tt
  \$\{PETSC\_DIR\}}) and architecture (specified by {\tt
  \$\{PETSC\_ARCH\}}), which are typically set as environmental
variables prior to compiling TAO source or programs.  As listed in the
sample makefile, the appropriate \texttt{include} file is automatically
completely specified; the user should {\em not} alter this statement
within the makefile.

Note that the variable \texttt{\$\{TAO\_LIB\}} (as listed on the link
line in this makefile) specifies {\em all} of the various TAO and
supplementary libraries in the appropriate order for correct linking.


\begin{comment}
  The second sample makefile, given in Figure~\ref{fig:make2},
  controls the generation of several example programs.  Again, the
  most important line in this makefile is the \texttt{include} line that
  includes the files defining all of the macro variables.
\end{comment}

Some additional variables that can be used in the makefile are defined
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{CFLAGS, FFLAGS} - user-specified additional options for the
  C++ compiler and fortran compiler.
\item \texttt{CPPFLAGS, FPPFLAGS} - user-specified additional flags
        for the C++ preprocessor and fortran preprocesor.
\item \texttt{CLINKER, FLINKER} - the C++ and Fortran linkers. 
\item \texttt{RM} - the remove command for deleting files.
\item \texttt{TAO\_LIB} - all of the base TAO libraries and required supplementary libraries.
             \findex{TAO_LIB}
\item \texttt{TAO\_FORTRAN\_LIB} - the TAO Fortran interface
             library. \findex{TAO_FORTRAN_LIB}
\item \texttt{PETSC\_FORTRAN\_LIB} - the PETSc Fortran interface
             library. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Directory Structure}

The home directory of TAO contains the following subdirectories:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{docs} - All documentation for TAO. The files \texttt{tao\_manual.ps}
                   and \texttt{manual/manual.html} contain the users manual in
                   PDF and HTML formats, respectively. Includes
                   the subdirectory
 \subitem - \texttt{manpages} (manual pages for individual TAO routines).
% \item \texttt{bin} - Utilities and short scripts for use with TAO, including
\item \texttt{bmake} - Base TAO makefile directory.  
\item \texttt{include} - All include files for TAO that are visible to the user.
\item \texttt{examples} - Example problems and makefile.
% \item \texttt{include/finclude}    - TAO include files for Fortran programmers using 
%                                   the .F suffix (recommended).
% \item \texttt{include/pinclude}    - Private TAO include files that should {\em not} 
%                                  be used by application programmers.
\item \texttt{src} - The source code for all TAO components, which
                  currently includes
 \begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{unconstrained} - unconstrained minimization,
 \item \texttt{bound} - bound constrained minimization.
 \item \texttt{complementarity} - mixed complementarity solvers.
 \item \texttt{least\_squares} - nonlinear least squares,
% \item \texttt{constrained} - constrained minimization,
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Each TAO source code component directory has the following subdirectories:
\begin{itemize}
\item  \texttt{examples} - Example programs for the component, including
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{tutorials} - Programs designed to teach users about TAO.  These
          codes can serve as templates for the design of custom applicatinos.
  \item \texttt{tests} - Programs designed for thorough testing of TAO.  As such,
          these codes are not intended for examination by users.
  \end{itemize}
\item  \texttt{interface} - The calling sequences for the abstract interface  
        to the component.
        Code here does not know about particular implementations.
\item  \texttt{impls} - Source code for one or more implementations.
\item  \texttt{utils} - Utility routines.  Source here may know about the 
          implementations, but ideally will not know about implementations
          for other components.
\end{itemize}
