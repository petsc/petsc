\section*{Acknowledgments}

The initial development of TAO was funded by the ACTS Toolkit Project in
the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research, U.S. Department
of Energy. We gratefully acknowledge their support.

TAO owes much to the developers of PETSc. We have benefitted
from their experience, tools, software, and advice. In many ways, TAO is a 
natural outcome of the PETSc development.
%
TAO has also benefitted from the work of various researchers
who have provided solvers, test problems, and interfaces.
In particular, we acknowledge Lisa Grignon, Liz Dolan, Boyana Norris, 
Gabriel Lopez-Calva, Yurii Zinchenko, Mike Gertz,
Jarek Nieplocha, Limin Zhang, and Manojkumar Krishnan.

\noindent
Finally, we thank all TAO users for their comments, bug reports, and
encouragement.
