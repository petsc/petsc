% Abstract for TAO Users Manual

\section*{Preface}

The Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO) focuses on the development
of algorithms and software for the solution of large-scale
optimization problems on high-performance architectures.  Areas of
interest include nonlinear least squares, unconstrained and
bound-constrained optimization, and general nonlinear optimization.

The development of TAO was motivated by the scattered support for
parallel computations and the lack of reuse of external toolkits in
current optimization software.  Our aim is to use object-oriented
techniques to produce high-quality optimization software for a range
of computing environments ranging from serial workstations and laptops
to massively parallel high-performance architectures.  Our design
decisions are strongly motivated by the challenges inherent in the use
of large-scale distributed memory architectures and the reality of
working with large, often poorly structured legacy codes for specific
applications.

This manual describes the use of TAO.
Since TAO is still under development, changes in usage and
calling sequences may occur.  TAO is fully supported; see the
the web site \url{http://www.mcs.anl.gov/tao} for information on
contacting the TAO developers.
