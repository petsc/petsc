Additional Capabilities that PETSc Needs:

  X - denotes accomplishment!
  * - denotes work in progress


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Highest priorities:    To do BEFORE the next release:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  X  add test to PetscCommDup_Private() to verify that all processors
     are using the same tag, when PETSC_BOPT_g is defined.

  X Fix include files for *.f programs (e.g., snes/examples/tests/ex10.f)

  * Use a USES_INT_MPI_COMM for Cray T3d and IRIX64 that use "native"
    MPI. Still needs testing.

  - Add VIEWER_STDOUT_(comm) modeled on VIEWER_DRAWX_WORLD() that
    automatically creates viewer for the communicator.

  - Add segmented sparse column format for scalar problems, reduces
    the number of loads required? Add otehr optimization that sorts by 
    row length, then loops over rows of each length doing rows unrolled.


  - Handle PCView_BJacobi, PCView_ASM for the case of multiple blocks with
    potentially different solvers on each
      - basic parallel
      - multiple blocks per processor
    What to do?  Possibilities:
      - create new local viewer for each proc (w/ same file name as
        current viewer), then use it when calling SLESView on the blocks?
          pros: easy.
          cons: still not necessarily good output format.
      - Send info to 1 proc, then print from it.
          pros: nice output format
          cons: a pain to do, unless there were a new routine like SLESGetInfo().
      - Maybe should have SLESGetInfo() anyway??
    
  - What to do for ASM, BJacobi PCs for -use_true_local and
    PCModifySubmatrices()?
    
  - Provide default color choices for PLogEventRegister() so
    user doesn't have to choose.  Provide documentation on the
    format and available options for colors.

  - Change PARCH_IRIX to PARCH_IRIX64 in bamke/IRIX64 and 
    all uses of PARCH_IRIX in the code need also || PARCH_IRIX64

  - Fix fortran interface for TS.

  * Make configure fully functional in PETSc 2.0
      - document usage somewhere
      - needs to handle:  set PETSCFLAGS
         - complex numbers: -DUSES_TEMPLATED_COMPLEX
         - etc.

  - Finish "Performance" chapter: section "System Related Problems"

  - Finish users manual:
      - Add info about BAIJ matrix to Chapter 15
      - Update viewer section (add VRML stuff, reorganize)

  - Fix VRML vector viewer interface; add documentation about VRML.

  - Aim for more exhaustive PETSc testing.  See
    /home/MPI/mpich/examples/test/rlist.srt:

  * Create an Database for examples

  * Reorganize examples, write a SLES tutorial
     - Lois' selections to be eliminated:  any objections?
         sles/examples/tests/ex18.c, snes/examples/ex1.c

  * Make sure to document any examples that are uniprocessor only.

  - Make all systems use shared libraries if possible, and document how to
    use these variants.

  * add -mpidump option that lists all unfinished MPI operations at end, 
         including PetscMPIDump()

  * Add diagnotics for memory allocation using PLogInfo (like already done 
    for AIJ format) for all matrix formats if it's not already in place.

  - Fix PCView() for ASM, block Jacobi, block GS so that parallel case
    is not just jumbled output.  If using same solvers on all blocks, print
    subSLES info once?  Or maybe better - collect info that differs among
    blocks/procs (such as LU nonzeros) and then print only from 1 proc.

  - ILUDT() - made MatILUDTFactor_SeqAIJ() stub.

  * Have all preconditioners (including LU) support null space, see 
            tools.n/solvers/nullsp.c petsc/src/pc/interface/pcnull.c

  * Make sure all Fortran examples run for complex on all machines, note
    this means the bmake files must insure that -DPETSC_COMPLEX is 
    properly set.

  - Do something about viewer formats - maybe use enum?

  * Test PETSc with LAM.
    
  - Fix binary I/O for complex numbers.

  - Fix GMRESCycle() so that test for "happy breakdown" is actually
    used.  See petsc-maint message #282 from David.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  To do sometime soon:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Provide better registration mechanism for PC, KSP, etc (based on
    MatReroderingRegister) to replace the lame procedure described in,
    e.g., PCRegisterAll.  

  - Chapter in users manual on how PETSc would be used with 
    different types of grid problems. Or different document.

  - ordering with flow direction - made MatReodering_SeqAIJ_Flow() stub.

  - add Flexible GMRES routine

  - cool example using KELP

  - HPF interface

  - interface to Tom Coleman's post-docs Cholesky code

  - try to set up Fortran error checking with
          forcheck (http://132.229.167.66:80/forcheck/) or 
          ftnchek (http://dv.go.dlr.de:8081/pdinfo_dv/ftnchek.html)
          lintfor (http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mac/manuals/hpux-manual-pages
                   /hpux/usr/man/man1/lintfor.1.html).


  - MatSetBlockValues()

  - Right and left preconditioning for all KSP types.

  - Augment some KSP methods to support symmetric preconditioning; fix relevant
     KSP support routines.

  ? Make jacobi and SOR be seperate for each matrix type. So then 
    have default use natural block size and support option 
    -pc_jacobi_pointwise etc.


  - Add routine for forming big matrix from a bunch of smaller ones, something 
       like:
        MatSetSubmatrix(Mat large,Mat small,int *rows, int *cols)

  - Write uniprocessor ICC code; possibly also introduce symmetric storage 
    variant.

   - Provide MPIU_MAXSUM and use it to replace use of MAT_SUM + MAT_MAX
     everywhere.

   - Add viewer for matrix graph - possibly interface to external software?
     (requested by Andreas) 

   - Allow one to view a reordered matrix, perhaps 
       by providing a MatReOrder(Mat,IS,IS,Mat*)?

   ? Reorganize multigrid code. (requested by Andreas).

   - Maybe add a routine VecCreateVecs()?  Seems useful to me instead of having
     to create a base vector, then duplicate it.

   ? Add copyright info to header of each file?  See, e.g., MPICH.

   - Examine the SPEC benchmarks to verify that we're using the appropriate
     compiler options for optimized code.  For info:  http://www.specbench.org


   * Make VecScatterCopy_  for the different types of scatters and use 
     a uniform naming scheme.

   - MatExpand() and VecExpand() talk to Paul about how this is done in SUMMA.

   - Make PLogFlops() also log loads and stores.


   * Add functionality to bjacobi to support block Gauss-Seidel
     including  support for coloring in parallel.

   * Develop basic PETSc benchmark suite

   - Develop additional test problems:
      - Develop utilities to create common matrices and vectors (for testing
        SLES, to serve as templates, and to fulfill basic needs).  
        See  /home/gropp/tools.n/solvers/examples/formsol.c and
        /home/gropp/tools.n/fd/* for ideas.
      - Convert more MINPACK-2 example problems to the PETSc coding style
      - Consider CUTE test suite

   - Redo parts of inline for basic operations and improved performance.

   * Parallel dense matrix implementation.

   - Introduce a concept of Vecs and provide multiple right hand side
     versions of MatMult.... Then do KSP versions.

   - Incorporate SPARSKIT strategy of Saad for managing AIJ data structure.
     (requested by Xiao Chuan Cai; this is supposedly much faster than
     our current code).

   * Improve history (-log_history) logging.

   - Finite difference approximations of derivatives using coloring

   * stride with multicomponent chunks in index sets, also two dimensional
     and three dimensional chunks

   * Develop code to rebalance matrices (and vectors) for better 
     load balance during matrix vector multiplies.

   - SNES suggestion from David Keyes:  Update Clipping
     Update clipping...  I used to think I was neurotic for doing this
     to Newton's method, but now I realize that "just about everyone" does
     it (quietly) when facing problems with bounded feasibility, such as a
     turbulent kinetic energy that cannot be permitted to go negative, or
     a mass fraction that cannot be allowed to exceed one, etc.  Essentially,
     the user would optionally provide bounds on unknowns.  The putative
     Newton correction would then be tested against these bounds.  The
     full update would be scaled back (or optionally some subset of its
     components) to assure feasibility.  This screws up the trust-region
     logic, of course.   It can be thought of us as introducing the most
     elementary form of constraints into the package: decoupled, explicit,
     and linear.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Features for TOHTML
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

   * Fix fact that first line of verbatim in html files have all leading blanks
     removed. (Note our makefile puts in three blanks before ierr which fixes
     90 percent of the problems for manual.html)
    (The verbatim handler for tothml seems not to put a carriage return 
     after the <pre><tt> and before the text. This causes the first line 
     of verbatim text to be printed incorrectly. I think this can be fixed
     by simply putting a \n after the outputed <pre><tt>)

   - allow inputed example files to have PETSc routine names mapped to manpages.

    doesn't handle \& correctly as a & in regular text.

    tothml doesn't handle \cite{} with -mapref../www/petsc.cit
    when the \cite is within an included file. 

    \ge doesn't seem to work correctly

    Also the automatic manpage finder feature invoked by -mapman does not
    seem to be able to handle function names with integers in them like
    DACreate2d()

    In the enumerate environment tothml doesn't seem to be able to handle
   \subitem and \subsubitem. It also seems to put to much blank space
    before and after the enumerate list. 

   An additional feature that would be great for tohtml, especially in
   handling large documents (such as the ever expanding PETSc users
   manual), is the optional addition of buttons for "Contents" and
   "Index" with the usual "up", "next", "previous" buttons.  

   Make \begin{tabular} environments look better. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                Accomplishments!  :) :)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  X Explain profiling, performance tuning in users manual

  X Add to documentation tips on getting parallel performance numbers, 
    including how to prevent the paging in of executable from screwing 
    up timings. sles ex21.c

  X Add -viewer_matlab_machine -viewer_matlab_port 

  X Fix SNES so that calling SNESSolve(), SNESDestroy() (without calling
    SNESSolve() in between) doesn't cause a seg fault.

  X Make ViewerGetFormat() a real public routine (seems good to me); else
    make it obviously private.

  X Fix MPIRowbs so factorization routiens return NEW matrix, NOT the 
    original matrix. Then fix MatMult() etc to make sure one does not
    multiply a factored matrix!!!!!!!!!!!!

  X Add provision so that all -info printouts indicate the associated
    processor.  In particular, storage allocation of submatrices for MATMPIAIJ:
      MatAssemblyEnd_SeqAIJ:Unneeded storage space 351 used 609 rows 60
    What processor is this coming from?

   X Add nonsymmetric matrix reorderings for use in LU (requested by Andreas)

   X When one is using a MatShell it would be nice if PC knew to use no
     preconditioning when no special preconditioner is applied. This would 
     prevent the annouying error message about MatGetDiagonal() when it 
     tries to use the default jacobi preconditioner.

   X Add error checking in SLESSolve(), MatMult(), PCApply(), etc. for the case 
     when input vector == output vector.

   X In-place ILU(0) for AIJ (Done), Row matrix formats (not done, should we?)

   X More nonlinear solvers, including those for unconstrained minimization

   X Make PETSc work using include/mpiuni.h (i.e. no MPI needed)

   X Make it possible to zoom in on viewed matrices.

   X Add iterative refinement or some similar technique to Unmodified 
     Gram-Schmidt code to cheaply stablize.

   X Change mytid and numtid(s) throughout code to rank and size to match
     MPI terms.

   X Upgrade WWW pages, especially installation information.  Use MPICH 
     format as a model.

   X Build new picture clipper for petsc homepage

   X make HTML summary to be pointed to by map.

   X Build wrapper for html manpages

  X Provide routine for initializeing Fortran side of PETSc when 
    main program is C. i.e. this sets common blocks and PETSC_NULL_Fortran

  X Reorganize format of manpages (both Unix and HTML) to display synopsis 
    before keywords and seealso.

  X Find out why snake doesn't count send/receives/wiats properly.
    Simply removed MPi logging from hpux machine.

  X Change default pc_type to ILU for one processor and BJacobi on 
    more then one except blocksolve that default to ILU.

  X Change PCSetUp_BJacobiAIJ() to use MatGetSubMatrices() rather then 
    MatGetSubMatrix() since someone decided MatGetSubMatrix cannot 
    be logged so MPIAIJ format with bjacobi is completely worthless 
    cause we don't have a clue as to how much time is spent getting 
    submatrices.

  X Remove Pipeline and Scatter_up, scatter_down support from the 
    scatter operations? They just make that code more complicated, harder
    to debug and harder to optimize?????

  X Fix PETSc components picture (add new matrices, pcs, etc)

  X Block compressed row storage format implementation.

  X Replace -log_summary data in Part 1 of users manual (to correspond
    with profiling chapter info (ILU/GMRES on 1 proc).

  X Provide a VecGetArray_Quick() for the matrix computational kernels
    and VecRestoreArray_Quick() <- Null macro. This is to save eight function 
    calls for every MatMult() etc. May not be noticable but can't do any harm.

  X Add PetscValidScalarPointer() and PetscValidIntPointer() to all 
    interface files to test that user is passing in correct integer or 
    Scalar pointer that PETSc is to access.

  X Make log summary print name of exceutable it is running

  X Fix -log_summary. Shows incorrect values for multiple satages

  X reorganize nightly builds, using /home/MPI/mpich/maint/runlist
    as an example.

  X Fix PetscSetDisplay so it is always called initially by all
    processors and sets a global static stored, then when called by
    program just returns that.

  X make ViewerPushFormat() ViewerPopFormat() use that to eliminate
    saving of formats in for example MatCreate().

  X Note fixes needed for ICASE SP (poseidon) in petsc/src/sys/src/mtr.c
    and petsc/src/viewer/impls/matlab/send.c

  X Take mention of BLACS and Scalapack from PETSc picture.

  X find LAgesvd_ on Cray T3D. Not supported by libsci.a, therefore
    we generate an error and exit.

  X Fix BDiag factorization to use Barry's new Linpack-modified stuff.
    Also change to actually invert diagonal blocks rather then keeping 
    triangular factors and doing triangular solves on the blocks in 
    each backsolve. As is done in SeqBAIJ.

  X For MatLoad() add support for automatically checking for file 
    filename.info that contains additional information on matrix in 
    unformated ascii. For example blocksize 5 and diagonals

  X Provide etags rule in makefile for public releases (no inclusion of
    *.tex files, etc.)

  X Fix the F*&^ bug that PETSc does not work on Cray T3d with two 
    processors bjacobi preconditioner with ILU(0) on subdomains!!!!!!!!
    For example, arco1

  X fix rules on all machines that do .F files, so they work properly 
    with PETSC_COMPLEX but don't generate warnign messages like
    cpp -I../../.. -I../../../include -I/usr/local/mpi/include  
    -I../../../src -O -D
    PETSC_DEBUG -DPETSC_BOPT_O  somefort.F  > somefort.f
    cpp: Invalid option `-O'
    gmake[1]: [../../../lib/libO_complex/freebsd_nolog/libpetscfortran
    .a(somefort.o)
    ] Error 33 (ignored)
    f77 -c  -O somefort.f

  X Fix F.o rules to pass proper flags; i.e. yes -I flags but maybe not
    -O flags on some machines, for example paragon.
  X fix output formats for -log_summary so that 3-digit numbers (e.g., 100.0) 
    doesn't screw up column alignment

  X update petscopts ( some of the options are outdated  for eg: pc_method )

  X extend PETSc PLogInfo() logging so that individual components can disable
    their printouts (e.g., get SNES logging but not matrix logging)

  X Debugger info? fixed. 

  X Fortran doesn't read aliases from .petscrc

  X Section on ASM in users manual.

  X Make a SNESMonitor() like the KSPMonitor() in kspimpl.h and 
    insure that it is sued everywhere instead of calls to (*snes->monitor)

  X Make -snes_xmonitor stash the DrawLG in SNES and then have it 
    destroyed in SNESDestroy(), like as is done for KSP.


  X Make a -ksp monitor that displays residual and true residual, like 
    the -ksp_bsmonitor. Added -ksp_truemonitor and -ksp_xtruemonitor

  X Test MATMPIROWBS for nonsymmetric matrices by building another 
    set of ARCO matrices by removing small values from them.

  X Change Scalabe ODE solvers to Scalable Time-Steppers

  X Allow users to pass petsc objects between Fortran and C.

  X add filename to petscinitialize for fortran

  X Fix PetscRandomCreate() so that it actually generates random numbers
    for all machines.

  X Fix PetscGetArchType() for Fortran.

  X Make MatGetArray_MPIDense().

  X rs6000_p4 machines:  Fortran programs don't print output when stdout
    is directed to a file (e.g., failure of sles/examples/ex7.F to
    print KSP residual norms in runex7).  Fix this.

  X Performance file: Elaborate on reuse of vectors, et by employing user
    context, use SNES examples for illustrations.

  X Fix PetscView demo log file to work with new profile format.
    Cleanup PetscView.

  X Add parallel viewer for MPIROWBS matrix format.

  X Add inode info to MatView() with info format.

  X Remove default stuff from MatCreate() into each matrix type, including
    processing command line options.

  X But in jump links for WWW manpages seealso.

  X Fix documentation for matrices in manual (also AIJ man pages).  
    Fix help info for matrices. MatPrintHelp().

   X Fix MPIRowbs format so that one can INSERT_VALUES with nonsymmetric matrix.

   X Make MatGetSubMatrices() for Seq and MPI AIJ.

   X Make MatIncreaseOverlap() for Seq and MPI AIJ.

   X Do overlapping additive Schwarz for Seq and MPI AIJ.

   X Fix SNES so that the right-hand-side of the Newton systems is not
     ever scaled by -1.0, but instead this is taken care of in the
     update step, x += alpha * dx   OR   x -= alpha * dx.

   X Complex versions of the Krylov subspace solvers

   X Complex version work from Fortran

   X Have -log_summary print percentages for different stages.

   X don't require user to set diagonal entries in mpirowbs, that is
     insane - says Barry.
   
   X But BlockSolve _requires_ a diagonal entry for each row, even if it is
     zero - says Lois.
     I have changed the MatCreateMPIRowbs() to create an initial matrix that 
     already has zeros on the diagonal so that the user need not set them

   X Allow column and row oriented input for MatSetValues() for all matrix
     types,

   X Increase user-definable events (needed by Tom Canfield).  Maybe now's
     the time to expand base PETSc events as well?

   X Parallel vector to parallel vector scatter.

   X Fix KSPSetGMRESxxx routines:  possibly zap 
     KSPGMRESSetUseUnmodifiedGramSchmidt() in favor of just
     KSPGMRESSetOrthogRoutine().

   X Make symbolic part of ILU(0) out of place fast for SeqAIJ. Just copy data 
     structures.

   X Change all CAPS macro to use _ between words, for example INSERT_VALUES

   X Add flag where user can announce that matrix is structurally symmetric and 
     that they are inserting all values for MPIRowbs, this prevents unneeded 
     communication.

   X Automatic collection of information about the solution process

   X Fortran interface

   X 1d wave equation, heat equation, etc examples with seperate graphics 
      for each processor.
 
   X Develop TK interfaces for options and monitoring 

   X Develop 1 and 3D distributed array code
