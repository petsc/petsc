                 is a useful building block for many algorithms in the
                 computational sciences, including graph coloring and
                 multigrid coarse grid creation on unstructured meshes.
                 We present an efficient asynchronous maximal
                 independent set algorithm for use on parallel
                 computers, for ``well partitioned'' graphs, that arise
                 from finite element (FE) models. For appropriately
                 partitioned bounded degree graphs, it is shown that the
                 running time of our algorithm under the P-RAM
                 computational model is of $O(1)$, which is an
                 improvement over the previous best P-RAM complexity for
                 this class of graphs. We present numerical experiments
                 on an IBM SP, that confirm our P-RAM complexity model
                 is indicative of the performance one can expect with
                 practical partitions on graphs from FE problems.",
