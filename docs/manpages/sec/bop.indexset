TAO uses a class called TaoIndexSet to describe parts of 
vectors and matrices.  These objects will be used to identify
particular elements of a vector or rows of a matrix.  Some solvers,
for instance, may want to know which elements of a vector are positive.
An index set should be able to describe which elements of the
vector satisfy this property.
This class has methods
which can be used within an optimization solver or application code.
These methods are virtual functions whose implementation depends upon
upon the internal representation of the data.
