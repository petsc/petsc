# or see $(PETSC_DIR)/readme for information on retrieving a subset.

# BLAS usually comes with SGI and can be accessed with -lblas listed 
# below for BLAS_LIB. However, the complex BLAS routine izamax() has
# a bug in it, so if you are using complex numbers we recommend using
# the SGI BLAS with extreme care.
