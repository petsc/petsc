#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  These libraries are available via Netlib,
# or see $(PETSC_DIR)/readme for information on retrieving a subset.
#
# If your machine has the file /usr/lang/SC3.0.1/lib/libsunperf.a then

#
# Location of MPI (Message Passing Interface) software  
# Note that version 1.1 of MPICH now requires linking pmpi when using mpe;
# make sure to remove the -lmpe and -lpmpi below if you are not using mpe or any 
# MPI profiling libraries. And remove the -DPETSC_HAVE_MPE from the bottom of the file.
