    "Decoding the DMPlex\n",

    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to provide a tutorial for the DMPlex features in PETSc. DMPlex and its sub-objects are an attempt to properly abstract out the concept of grids and the assignment of degree of freedom information to entities in that grid. The hope is that this will allow for easy implementation of different discretization ideas and subsequently lead to their fair comparison. To be able to use DMPlex you need to speak its language and understand how to get the information your methods need. In this tutorial I will explain and demonstrate the functionality of the DMPlex API."
