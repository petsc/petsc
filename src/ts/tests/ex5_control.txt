14. INITIAL DOMAIN:
15. Initiation specifier..................1

INITIAL DOMAIN DESCRIPTION:
- To only diabatic dT/dt contributions (all fields uniform throughout grid) enter 0 in line 15
- Default initiation is a west-east temperature gradient, wind = 0, and two high pressure perturbations in the mass field


DESCRIPTION OF INPUTS:
- All temperature is in degrees Fahrenheit.
- Fraction is from 0 to 1. where 0=0% of sky covered by clouds, 1 = 100% of sky covered by clouds (overcast)
- Wind speed is in miles per hour
- Precipitable water is in centimeters
- Wind direction is from 0 to 360. where 0 is wind from north, 90 is east, 180 is south, 270 is west, 360 is also north.
- Runtime is in hours

NOTE:
- Moisture if only used for radiative considerations
- Wind input is only used for latent and sensible heat fluxes. The dynamic winds do not affect the surface energy budget 
- Model is not designed to be run for longer than 15 hours
