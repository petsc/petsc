    Information on VecScatter used in matrix-vector product: 
    [0] Number sends = 0; Number to self = 0
    [0] Number receives = 1; Number from self = 0
    [0] 0 length 1 from whom 3
    Now the indices for all remote receives (in order by process received from)
    [0] 0 
    [1] Number sends = 0; Number to self = 0
    [1] Number receives = 1; Number from self = 0
    [1] 0 length 1 from whom 3
    Now the indices for all remote receives (in order by process received from)
    [1] 0 
    [2] Number sends = 0; Number to self = 0
    [2] Number receives = 1; Number from self = 0
    [2] 0 length 1 from whom 3
    Now the indices for all remote receives (in order by process received from)
    [2] 0 
    [3] Number sends = 3; Number to self = 0
    [3]   0 length = 1 to whom 0
    [3]   1 length = 1 to whom 1
    [3]   2 length = 1 to whom 2
    Now the indices for all remote sends (in order by process sent to)
