      <p>
        With the advent of multicore machines as standard practice from laptops
        to supercomputers, the issue of a hybrid MPI-thread (for example, MPI-OpenMP)
        "version" of PETSc is of interest.  In this model, one MPI process per
        CPU (node) and several threads on that CPU (node) work together inside
        that MPI process. </p>

      <p>The core PETSc team has come to the consensus that pure MPI
      using neighborhood collectives and the judicious using of MPI
      shared memory (for data structures that you may not wish to have
      duplicated on each MPI process due to memory constraints) will
      provide the best performance for HPC simulation needs on current generation systems, next generation systems and exascale systems.
      It is also a much simpler programming model
      then MPI + threads (leading to simpler code). </p>

       <p> Note that the PETSc team has no problems with proposals to
       replace the pure MPI programming model with a different
       programming model but only with an alternative that is
       demonstrably __better__, not with something more complicated
       that has not been demonstrated to be better nor that has any
       technical reason to be believed to be any better. Ever since
       the IBM SP2 in 1996 we've been told that
       "pure MPI won't scale to the next generation of machine", this
       has yet to be true and there is no reason to believe that it
       will be true.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though the current and planned programming model for PETSc is
       pure MPI we do provide some limited support for use with the
       hybrid MPI-thread model. These are discussed below.  Many
       people throw around the term "hybrid MPI-thread" as if it is a
       trivial change in the programming model. It is not -- major
       ramifications must be understood if such a hybrid approach is
       to be used successfully.  Hybrid approaches can be developed in
       many ways that affect usability and performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><u>The simple model of PETSc with threads</u></b> is to contain all
        the thread operations <b><u>inside</u></b> the Mat and Vec classes,
        leaving the user's programming model identical to what it is today. This
        model can be done in two ways by having Vec and Mat class implementations
        that use
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>OpenMP compiler directives to parallelize some of the methods</li>
        <li>POSIX threads (pthread) calls to parallelize some of the methods. </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We tried this approach (with support for both OpenMP and pthreads) and found the code was never faster than
        pure MPI and cumbersome to use hence we have removed it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><u>An alternative simple model of PETSc with
        threads</u></b> is to have individual threads (OpenMP or others) to each
        manage their own (sequential) PETSc objects (and each thread
        can interact only with its own objects). This is useful when
        one has many small systems (or sets of ODEs) that must be
        integrated in an "embarrassingly parallel" fashion.
      </ol>

      <p>
        To use this feature one must ./configure PETSc with the option --with-threadsafety --with-log=0 [--with-openmp or --download-concurrencykit]. src/ksp/ksp/tutorials/ex61f.F90 demonstrates how this may be used with OpenMP. The code uses a small number of #pragma omp critical in non-time-critical locations in the code and thus only works with OpenMP and not with pthreads.
      </p>


      <p>
        <b><u>A more complicated model of PETSc with threads</u></b>, which would
        allow users to write threaded code that made PETSc calls, is not
        supported because PETSc is not currently thread-safe. Because the issues
        involved with toolkits and thread safety are complex, this short answer
        is almost meaningless. Thus, this page attempts to explain how threads
        and thread safety relate to PETSc. Note that we are discussing here only
        "software threads" as opposed to "hardware threads."
      </p>

      <p>Threads are used in 2 main ways in HPC:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <span class="warning">Loop-level compiler control.</span> The
          C/C++/FORTRAN compiler manages the dispatching of threads at the
          beginning of a loop, where each thread is assigned non-overlapping
          selections from the loop. OpenMP, for example, defines standards
          (compiler directives) for indicating to compilers how they should
          "thread parallelize" loops.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="warning">User control.</span> The programmer manages the
          dispatching of threads directly by assigning threads to tasks (e.g.,
          a subroutine call). For example, consider POSIX threads (pthreads) or
          the user thread management in OpenMP.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Threads are merely streams of control and do not have any global data
        associated with them. Any global variables (e.g., common blocks in
        FORTRAN) are "shared" by all the threads; that is, any thread can
        access and change that data. In addition, any space allocated (e.g., in
        C with malloc or C++ with new) to which a thread has a reference can be
        read/changed by that thread. The only private data a thread has are the
        local variables in the subroutines that it has called (i.e., the stack
        for that thread) or local variables that one explicitly indicates are
        to be not shared in compiler directives.
      </p>

      <p>
        In its simplest form, thread safety means that any memory (global or
        allocated) to which more than one thread has access, has some mechanism
        to ensure that the memory remains consistent when the various threads
        act upon it. This can be managed by simply associating a lock with each
        "memory" and making sure that each thread locks the memory before
        accessing it and unlocks when it has completed accessing the memory. In
        an object oriented library, rather than associating locks with
        individual data items, one can think about associating locks with
        objects; so that only a single thread can operate on an object at
        a time.
      </p>

      <p>PETSc is not "generically" "thread-safe" because: </p>

      <ol>

        <li>
          All the PETSc objects created during a simulation do not have locks
          associated with them. Again, the reason is performance; having always
          to lock an object before using it, and then unlocking it at the end
          would have a large impact on performance. Even with very inexpensive
          locks, there will still likely be a few "hot-spots" that kill
          performance.  For example, if four threads share a matrix and are
          each calling MatSetValues(), this will be a bottleneck with those
          threads constantly fighting over the data structure inside the matrix
          object.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <span class="warning">Some concerns about a thread model for parallelism</span>.
        A thread model for parallelism of numerical methods appears to be powerful
        for problems that can store their data in very simple (well controlled) data
        structures. For example, if field data is stored in a two-dimensional array,
        then each thread can be assigned a nonoverlapping slice of data to operate on.
        OpenMP makes managing much of this sort of thing reasonably straightforward.
      </p>

      <p>
        When data must be stored in a more complicated opaque data structure
        (for example an unstructured grid or sparse matrix), it is more
        difficult to partition the data among the threads to prevent conflict
        and still achieve good performance. More difficult, but certainly not
        impossible.  For these situations, perhaps it is more natural for each
        thread to maintain its own private data structure that is later merged
        into a common data structure. But to do this, one has to introduce
        a great deal of private state associated with the thread, i.e., it
        becomes more like a "light-weight process".
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, at least for the PETSc package, the concept of being
        thread-safe is not simple. It has major ramifications about its
        performance and how it would be used; it is not a simple matter of
        throwing a few locks around and then everything is honky-dory.
