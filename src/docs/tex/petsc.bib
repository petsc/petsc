  Abstract                 = {In the numerical simulation of atmospheric transport-chemistry processes, a major task is the integration of the stiff systems of ordinary differential equations describing the chemical transformations. It is therefore of interest to systematically search for stiff solvers which can be identified as close to optimal for atmospheric applications. In this paper we continue our investigation from Sandu et al. (1996, CWI Report NM-R9603 and Report in Comput. Math., No. 85) and compare eight solvers on a set of seven box-models used in present day models. The focus is on Rosenbrock solvers. These turn out to be very well suited for our application when they are provided with highly efficient sparse matrix techniques to economize on the linear algebra. Two of the Rosenbrock solvers tested are from the literature, viz. and 4, and two are new and specially developed for air quality applications, viz. 3 and 3. }

	abstract = {{Design Patterns is a modern classic in the literature of object-oriented development, offering timeless and elegant solutions to common problems in software design. It describes patterns for managing object creation, composing objects into larger structures, and coordinating control flow between objects. The book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a tutorial but a catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application--a selection for virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent, well-engineered object-oriented designs.} {Now on CD, this internationally acclaimed bestseller is more valuable than ever!

Use the contents of the CD to create your own design documents and reusable components. The CD contains: 23 patterns you can cut and paste into your own design documents; sample code demonstrating pattern implementation; complete Design Patterns content in standard HTML format, with numerous hyperlinked cross-references; accessed through a standard web browser; Java-based dynamic search mechanism, enhancing online seach capabilities; graphical user environment, allowing ease of navigation.

First published in 1995, this landmark work on object-oriented software design presents a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to common design problems. Created by four experienced designers, the 23 patterns contained herein have become an essential resource for anyone developing reusable object-oriented software. In response to reader demand, the complete text and pattern catalog are now available on CD-ROM. This electronic version of Design Patterns enables programmers to install the book directly onto a computer or network for use as an online reference for creating reusable object-oriented software.

The authors first describe what patterns are and how they can help you in the design process. They then systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. All patterns are compiled from real-world examples and include code that demonstrates how they may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages such as C++ and Smalltalk. Readers who already own the book will want the CD to take advantage of its dynamic search mechanism and ready-to-install patterns.}},

Fibre bundles, now an integral part of differential geometry, are also of great importance in modern physics--such as in gauge theory. This book, a succinct introduction to the subject by renown mathematician Norman Steenrod, was the first to present the subject systematically.

It begins with a general introduction to bundles, including such topics as differentiable manifolds and covering spaces. The author then provides brief surveys of advanced topics, such as homotopy theory and cohomology theory, before using them to study further properties of fibre bundles. The result is a classic and timeless work of great utility that will appeal to serious mathematicians and theoretical physicists alike.

The algorithm computes the forces on an arbitrary distribution of bodies in a time which scales as N log N with the particle number. The accuracy of the force calculations is analytically bounded, and can be adjusted via a user defined parameter between a few percent relative accuracy, down to machine arithmetic accuracy. Instead of using pointers to indicate the topology of the tree, we identify...},

These directions are  determined by analyzing samples of algebraically smooth error, e. Neighboring grid points i  and j are called smoothly coupled if e i and e j are consistently nearby in value. In addition,  these dierences may be used to dene interpolation weights. These new ideas may be  incorporated into the algebraic multigrid method. Test results show that the new method  can have much lower grid and operator complexities compared to AMG, leading to lower  solve timings.  1 },

Heuristics based on interpolation quality measures are used to guide the agglomeration procedure. The performance of the resulting method is demonstrated in two-level numerical experiments.}},

 abstract = {We consider multiphysics applications from algorithmic and
architectural perspectives, where ``algorithmic'' includes both
mathematical analysis and computational complexity and
``architectural'' includes both software and hardware environments.
Many diverse multiphysics applications can be reduced, en route to
their computational simulation, to a common algebraic coupling
paradigm. Mathematical analysis of multiphysics coupling in this form
is not always practical for realistic applications, but model problems
representative of applications discussed herein can provide insight.
A variety of software frameworks for multiphysics applications have
been constructed and refined within disciplinary communities and
executed on leading-edge computer systems.  We examine several of
these, expose some commonalities among them, and attempt to
extrapolate best practices to future systems. From our study, we
summarize challenges and forecast opportunities.}
