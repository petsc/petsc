============
Changes: 3.2
============


   .. rubric:: General:

   -  --download-c-blas-lapack is replaced with --download-f2cblaslapack
   -  --with-precision=__float128 --download-f2cblaslapack is now
      support for newish GNU gcc compiler
   -  Calling sequence of PetscBinarRead.m has been changed
   -  All XXXDestroy() functions now take a pointer to the object itself
      so that it can be nullified after destruction.
   -  PetscError() and SETERRQX() now take a MPI_Comm as the first
      argument to indicate where the error is known. If you don't know
      what communicator use then pass in PETSC_COMM_SELF
   -  Added PetscObjectAddOptionsHandler() that allows adding new
      routines to any object that are called to process options when
      XXXSetFromOptions() is called.
   -  Changed PetscTruth to PetscBool, PETSC_TRUTH to PETSC_BOOL,
      PetscOptionsTruth to PetscOptionsBool, etc.
   -  Introduced PetscCopyMode
   -  Changed -log_history to -history and PetscLogOpenHistory()
      PetscLogCloseHistory() to PetscOpenHistory(), PetscCloseHistory()
      because "log" is reserved for related to the performance logging
   -  Changed PetscOptionsPrint() to PetscOptionsView()
   -  Changed PetscLogPrintSummary() to PetscLogView()
   -  Using gcc 4.6 you can now ./configure --with-precision=__float128
      --download-qblaslapack to get computations in quad precision.
      gfortran 4.6 is also supported. Warning some of the PETSc printing
      of numbers in some places will print garbage. I haven't figured
      out a way to handle the %G format. Can be run in parallel :-)
   -  PetscFListFind() now takes a searchlibraries flag, if this is set
      and the function is NOT found in the function list then the
      libraries and executable are searched (when shared or dynamic
      libraries are used). Previously it always search the libraries and
      executables if not found in the list.
   -  PetscOpenMPxxx() utilities are now PetscHMPIxxx() for hierarchical
      MPI, the previous name was bad

   .. rubric:: Logging:

   -  PetscCookie changed to PetscClassId in all forms.

   .. rubric:: config/configure.py:

   -  --with-64-bit-pointers option removed. It doesn't work properly
      anway. The user should specify the correct 32bit or 64bit
      compilers to configure. For eg:
      ``configure --with-cc='gcc -m64'             --with-fc='gfortran -m64'``
   -  Python requirement is changed from 2.2 to 2.3
   -  Changed --with-shared to --with-shared-libraries,
      --known-mpi-shared to --known-mpi-shared-libraries and
      --with-dynamic to --with-dynamic-loading
   -  'ifneeded' support removed. '--download-package=ifneeded' should
      now be '--download-package'
   -  The make macro PETSC_INCLUDE has been replaced by
      PETSC_CC_INCLUDES and PETSC_FC_INCLUDES for C and Fortran,
      respectively.

   .. rubric:: IS:

   -  ISBlock(),ISStride() are removed. Use
      PetscTypeCompare((PetscObject)is,ISBLOCK,&flag),
      PetscTypeCompare((PetscObject)is,ISSTRIDE,&flag) instead.
   -  Added ISCreate(), ISSetType(), ISRegister() etc to match style of
      other PETSc objects. Also added ISGeneralSetIndices(),
      ISBlockSetIndices(), ISStrideSetStride()
   -  ISCreateGeneral() and ISCreateBlock() now takes PetscCopyMode as
      an argument and hence ISCreateGeneralNC() and
      ISCreateGeneralWithArray() are not needed and removed. Use
      ISCreateGeneral() with the argument PETSC_OWN_POINTER and
      PETSC_USE_POINTER instead.
   -  ISLocalToGlobalMappingCreate() now takes PetscCopyMode as an
      additional argument and ISLocalToGlobalMappingCreateNC() is no
      longer needed and removed
   -  ISStrideToGeneral() is replaced with ISToGeneral() that works for
      all basic IS types.
   -  ISCreateBlock() now takes indexing relative to block, no longer
      relative to element. This is to match the paradigm of
      Vec/MatSetValuesBlocked()
   -  ISBlockGetBlockSize() is now ISGetBlockSize(). Block sizes can be
      set for conforming ISGENERAL and ISSTRIDE using ISSetBlockSize().
   -  ISAllGatherIndices() is removed, use ISCreateGeneral() then
      ISAllGather().

   .. rubric:: PF:

   -  The source array is marked constant in PFApply and the callback.

   .. rubric:: Vec:

   -  changed VecSqrt() to VecSqrtAbs()
   -  VecLoad() and VecLoadIntoVector() have been merged into a single
      NEW VecLoad() that takes a partially constructed vector as input
      and loads according to any type or sizes that have previously been
      set into the Vec.
   -  VecDestroyVecs(PetscInt n,Vec \**) instead of
      VecDestroyVecs(Vec**,PetscInt n), also VecDestroyVecsF90(PetscInt
      n,{Vec, pointer :: x},PetscErrorCode ierr)
   -  VecLoad() does NOT access the options database to check for the
      VecType, call VecSetFromOptions() first if you wish to check it.
   -  VecDestroyVecs() now takes the pointer to the first array and
      zeros it on return
   -  VecDestroy() now zeros the pointer to the destroyed vector so it
      cannot be reused
   -  VecDestroyVecs(PetscInt n,Vec \**) instead of
      VecDestroyVecs(Vec**,PetscInt n)

   .. rubric:: VecScatter:

   -  The ghost indices for VecCreateGhostBlock() and
      VecCreateGhostBlockWithArray() are now by block instead of by
      entry.

   .. rubric:: Mat:

   -  MAT_SOLVER_XXX is now MATSOLVERXXX
   -  MAT_PARTIONING_XXX is now MATPARTITIONINGXXX
   -  MATCOLORING_XXX is now MATCOLORINGXXX
   -  MATORDERING_XXX is now MATORDERINGXXX
   -  It is an error to call MatSetOption() before the implementation
      has been created (after MatSetSizes() and MatSetType()). Formerly,
      options were silently ignored in this circumstance.
   -  Added MatSetMumpsIcntl()
   -  MatLoad() now takes a created Mat as input (and no longer a Mat
      type), if you provide the size and type in the Mat then that is
      used other defaults are used.
   -  MATCRL -> MATAIJCRL, MATSEQCRL -> MATSEQAIJCRL, MATMPICRL ->
      MATMPIAIJCRL
   -  MatCreateSeqCRL() -> MatCreateSeqAIJCRL() MatCreateMPICRL() ->
      MatCreateMPIAIJCRL()
   -  MATCSRPERM -> MATAIJPERM, MATSEQCSRPERM -> MATSEQAIJPERM,
      MATMPICSRPERM -> MATMPIAIJPERM
   -  MatCreateSeqCSRPERM() -> MatCreateSeqAIJPERM()
      MatCreateMPICSRPERM() -> MatCreateMPIAIJPERM()
   -  Added MatZeroRowsColumns() and MatZeroRowsColumnsIS().
   -  MatZeroRows() and MatZeroRowsIS() now take an x and b vector as
      optional arguments; if these are provided then the b[idx[i]] is
      set to diag*x[idx[i]]] for all rows listed in idx[].
   -  MatSetLocalToGlobalMapping() and MatSetLocalToGlobalMappingBlock()
      now take separate row and column maps. MatPreallocateSetLocal()
      has an extra argument for the column mapping.
   -  MatLoad() does NOT access the options database to check for the
      MatType, call MatSetFromOptions() first if you wish to check it.
   -  Removed MatMFFDSetFromOptions() since one can call
      MatSetFromOptions()
   -  MatGetLocalMat() and MatGetLocalMatCondensed() are now
      MatMPIAIJGetLocalMat() and MatMPIAIJGetLocalMatCondensed()
   -  MatOption MAT_USE_COMPRESSEDROW changed to
      MAT_CHECK_COMPRESSED_ROW

   .. rubric:: PC:

   -  PCFieldSplitSetIS() and PCFieldSplitSetFields() now take a
      split-name parameter which is used to define the options database
      keys.
   -  CHOLMOD can be used for Cholesky factorization using AIJ or
      SBAIJ(1) matrix formats.
   -  PCREDUNDANT now uses the inner KSP with the inner PC. Default is
      still preonly for KSP and LU for PC so default behavior is the
      same but now you can use for example -redundant_ksp_gmres.
      PCRedundantGetPC() is now changed to PCRedundantGetKSP()
   -  The header "petscmg.h" is renamed to "petscpcmg.h", "petscasa.h"
      is renamed to "petscpcasa.h".
   -  The preconditioner PCBFBT has been removed. The same functionality
      is available in PCFIELDSPLIT.
   -  PCOPENMP is now PCHMPI and its prefix is now -hmpi\_ for
      heirarchical MPI
   -  PCMGSetGalerkin() has a second argument of type PetscBool.

   .. rubric:: KSP:

   -  KSPSetPreconditionerSide() changed to KSPSetPCSide() to match name
      of second argument
   -  -ksp_right_pc -ksp_left_pc changed to -ksp_pc_side
      left,right,symmetric to match KSPSetPCSide()
   -  Added KSPGMRESGetRestart() and KSPGMRESGetCGSRefinementType()
   -  Added KSPGMRESGetOrthogonalization()
   -  KSPAddOptionsChecker() is replaced with
      PetscObjectAddOptionsHandler()
   -  Added KSPSPECEST which estimates the spectrum on the first solve
      and uses it to configure a reduction-free method for subsequent
      solves, intended for use when reductions are expensive such as
      levels of multigrid.

   .. rubric:: SNES:

   -  Added SNESLineSearchSetMonitor() and -snes_ls_monitor.
   -  Add SNESKSPONLY, for solving linear problems with SNES.
   -  Added the minlambda argument to SNESLineSearchGetParams() and
      SNESLineSearchSetParams().

   .. rubric:: TS:

   -  Rename TSCRANK_NICHOLSON to TSCN and TSRUNGE_KUTTA to TSRK for
      consistency.
   -  TSSetIFunction() and TSSetRHSFunction() have an additional
      argument for the vector to compute the function value in. If
      PETSC_NULL is used, then one is created by the TS.
   -  TSSetMatrices() has been removed, use TSSetIFunction() and
      TSSetRHSFunction(), perhaps providing Jacobian matrices and
      TSComputeRHSFunctionLinear() and/or
      TSComputeRHSJacobianConstant(). See
      src/ts/examples/tutorials/ex{2,4,5,6}.c for an example.
   -  Added TSARKIMEX: additive Runge-Kutta implicit-explicit methods
      for multi-rate systems.
   -  Changed TSStep() interface to only perform one step, added
      TSSolve() to perform multiple steps with callbacks and monitors if
      desired.
   -  Added TSSetExactFinalTime(), replaces
      TSSundialsSetExactFinalTime().

   .. rubric:: DM/DA:

   -  Change array argument of DAGetArray and related functions from
      void*\* to void\* to avoid the need for an explicit cast (the
      argument still has the meaning of a pointer to d-dimensionally
      indexed array of user-defined node type, old code will still
      compile correctly but the cast is no longer necessary).
   -  DAGetCoordinates(), DAGetGhostedCoordinates(), and
      DAGetCoordinateDA() now return borrowed references. The returned
      object should not be destroyed by the user.
   -  Added DAVecGetArrayF90()
   -  Changed DASetVertexDivision to DASetOwnershipRanges
   -  The SDA object and all its method have been removed
   -  The DA, ADDA, Slice and DMComposite objects are now all
      represented by a DM object.
   -  Routines that began with ADDA and Slice now begin with DMADDA and
      DMSlice
   -  DA/ADDA/Slice/DMCompositeGetMatrix() -> DMGetMatrix(), similar for
      all other routines that have a DM version
   -  Removed DASetType(), DARegister() etc since they will all be
      handled via DMSetType() etc
   -  Added DMSetUp() that is called, for example, after all the
      parameters are passed to the DM object to actually construct the
      data structures; replace all calls to DASetType() with calls to
      DMSetUp()
   -  DAXXX() routines are now either DMXXX() or DMDAXXX() see
      petscdmda.h for details
   -  The operation DALocalToGlobal() which performed no communication
      can now be performed with DMLocalToGlobalBegin/End() with
      INSERT_VALUES.
   -  petscda.h, petscdadef.h and petscda.h90 are now petscdmda.h,
      petscdmdadef.h, and petscdmda.h90
   -  DAGetISLocalToGlobalMapping() and
      DAGetISLocalToGlobalMappingBlck() are now
      DMGetLocalToGlobalMapping() and DMGetLocalToGlobalMappingBlock()
      and are collective since they may be constructed lazily.
   -  DMGetBlockSize() is added.
   -  Changed DMDAPeriodicType to DMDABoundaryType, and changed this
      enum to only specify one boundary (one for each dimension). This
      enum is now one of DMDA_BOUNDARY_NONE, DMDA_BOUNDARY_GHOSTED, or
      DMDA_BOUNDARY_PERIODIC. See DMDABoundaryType man page for more.
   -  DMDASetPeriodicity() is now DMDASetBoundaryType(), and API is
      changed to take three DMDABoundaryType arguments.
   -  Changed API for DMDACreate*D(), DMDAGetInfo() to take the correct
      number of DMDABoundaryType enums for the dimension.
   -  DMDASetGhostedCoordinates() is added to set coordinates of
      non-periodic ghost cells.

   .. rubric:: DMMG:

   .. rubric:: PetscViewer:

   -  PETSC_VIEWER_XXX is now PETSCVIEWERXXX
   -  Added PetscViewerASCIIOpenWithFILE() and PetscViewerASCIISetFILE()
   -  Added PetscViewerASCIISynchronizedAllow() which must be called
      before using PetscViewerASCIISynchronizedPrintf()

   .. rubric:: SYS:

   -  PetscOptionsAtoi(),PetscOptionsAtod(),PetscOptionsAtol() ->
      PetscOptionsStringToInt(), PetscOptionsStringToReal(),
      PetscOptionsStringToBool()
   -  PetscFListFind() takes an additional argument to look up the
      symbol in dynamically loaded libraries if not already in the list.
   -  Added PetscBagSetOptionsPrefix(), which allows a prefix for the
      option names of bag items.
   -  The preloading macros as well as developer-level logging and
      profiling functions have been namespaced, e.g. PreLoadBegin() is
      now PetscPreLoadBegin().
