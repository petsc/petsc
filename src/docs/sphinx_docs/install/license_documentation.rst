Contributing License Agreement
==============================

Contributions are accepted via `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc>`__ merge requests.
If you are planning a large contribution, we encourage you to discuss the concept on the
petsc-dev@mcs.anl.gov :ref:`mailing list <doc_mail>` and interact with us frequently to
ensure that your effort is well-directed. See the developers :ref:`documentation
<ind_developers>` for further details.

PETSc is distributed under a 2-clause :ref:`BSD license <doc_license>` (see above). The
act of submitting a merge request (with or without an explicit Signed-off-by tag) will be
understood as an affirmation of the following:
