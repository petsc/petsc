============
Changes: 3.3
============


   .. rubric:: config/configure.py:

   -  Building PETSc using CMake is enabled automatically if CMake is
      installed (enabling parallel builds and fast incremental builds),
      otherwise the plain make-based system is used.
   -  Added --with-cuda-only flag to allow compiling CUDA files without
      requiring Thrust and Cusp

   .. rubric:: Vec:

   -  VecCreateSeqWithArray() and VecCreateMPIWithArray() now take a
      blocksize argument before the local length
   -  VecSetBlockSize() cannot be called after VecCreateSeq() or
      VecCreateMPI() and must be called before VecSetUp() or
      VecSetFromOptions() or before either VecSetType() or VecSetSizes()

   .. rubric:: Mat:

   -  MatScaleSystem() and MatUnScaleSystem() are gone, they didn't do
      anything.
   -  Renamed MatNullSpaceAttach() to MatSetNullSpace()
   -  MatMult() no longer removes the nullspace set by MatSetNullSpace()
   -  Renamed MatMatMultTranspose() for C=A^T*B to MatTransposeMatMult()
   -  Added MatMatTransposeMult() for C=A*B^T
   -  Added MatRARt() for C=R*A*R^T
   -  Preallocation routines now automatically set
      MAT_NEW_NONZERO_ALLOCATION_ERR, if you intentionally preallocate
      less than necessary then use
      MatSetOption(mat,MAT_NEW_NONZERO_ALLOCATION_ERR,PETSC_FALSE) to
      disable the error generation.
   -  MatSetBlockSize() must be called before MatSetUp() or
      MatXXXXSetPreallocation() or block size defaults to 1
   -  -mat_block_size is NOT processed by MatXXXXSetPreallocation() you
      MUST call MatSetFromOptions() before MatSetUp() to have it
      processed
   -  You MUST now call MatXXXSetPreallocation() or MatSetUp() on any
      matrix you create directly (not using DMCreateMatrix()) before
      calling MatSetValues(), MatSetValuesBlocked() etc.
   -  MatGetOwnershipRange() will not work without setting up the
      matrix.
   -  MatSetUpPreallocation() and MatPreallocated() are removed, use
      MatSetUp()
   -  MatPreallocateSymmetricInitialize() is removed, use
      MatPreallocateInitialize()
   -  MatCreateMPIAIJ(), MatCreateMPIBAIJ(), MatCreateMPISBAIJ(),
      MatCreateMPIDense() are now MatCreateAIJ(), MatCreateBAIJ(),
      MatCreateSBAIJ(), MatCreateDense(). Note that on a single process
      they have always created the sequential version of the matrix so
      this naming is more accurate.
   -  Renamed MatMerge_SeqsToMPI() to MatCreateMPIAIJSumSeqAIJ()
   -  Renamed MatMerge() to MatCreateMPIAIJConcatenateSeqAIJ()
   -  Added block size in call to MatCreateIS()
   -  MatInvertBlockDiagonal() now returns a const pointer

   .. rubric:: PC:

   -  Remove PCASASetDM(), use PCSetDM() instead.

   -  Add PCFieldSplitSetSchurFactType(), rename
      -pc_fieldsplit_schur_factorization_type to
      -pc_fieldsplit_schur_fact_type.

   -  Added native algebraic multigrid method -pc_type gamg. Aggregation
      method is recommended: -pc_gamg_type agg and for elliptic
      operators smoothing is recommended: -pc_gamg_agg_nsmooths 1.

   -  PCSetCoordinates(PC,PetscInt,PetscInt,PetscReal*) added second
      integer argument for number of local vertices.

   -  Added PCISSetSubdomainScalingFactor(PC,PetscScalar).

   -  .. rubric:: PCGASM:

      -  Remove PCGASMSetLocalSubdomains(), use PCGASMSetSubdomains();
         **note:** the first argument is now the list of "inner"
         subdomains (without overlap), unlike before and for PCASM
      -  PCGASMSetTotalSubdomains(PC,PetscInt,PetscBool); added third
         argument to indicate whether local subdomains should be
         constructed.
      -  Removed PCGASMCreateSubdomains(), use
         PCGASMCreateLocalSubdomains(Mat,PetscInt,PetscInt,IS*[],IS*[]);
         second PetscInt argument is requested overlap
      -  PCGASMCreateSubdomains2D(PC,PetscInt,PetscInt,PetscInt,PetscInt,PetscInt,PetscInt,PetscInt*,IS[]*,IS[]*):
         the 9-th and 10-th argument have been swapped: the 9-th outputs
         the inner subdomains, the 10-th outputs the outer subdomains.

   -  PCMG multigrid defaults changed to use a Chebyshev smoother with
      block Jacobi Gauss-Seidel relaxation. This is a linear
      preconditioner so it can be used with normal Krylov methods rather
      than only flexible methods, as well as having fewer
      synchronization pointst. Use
      ``-mg_levels_ksp_type gmres -mg_levels_ksp_max_it 1 -mg_levels_pc_type bjacobi``
      for the original behavior.

   .. rubric:: KSP:

   -  KSPSetOperators() will automatically set the null space present on
      the input matrix
   -  Renamed KSPCHEBYCHEV to KSPCHEBYSHEV
   -  Added Hybrid CHEBYCHEV (-ksp_chebyshev_hybrid)
   -  Added pipelined GMRES (KSPPGMRES) which performs one non-blocking
      reduction per iteration instead of two blocking reductions.
   -  Added flexible BiCGStab (KSPFBCGS) which tolerates a nonlinear
      preconditioner (like KSPFGMRES).
   -  Added improved flexible BiCGStab (KSPIFBCGS) which tolerates a
      nonlinear preconditioner and performs one reduction every other
      iteration (like KSPIBCGS).

   .. rubric:: SNES:

   -  Added SNESGetSNESLineSearch
   -  Changed default max_its and max_funcs for non-newton SNES solvers
      to 10000 and 30000 respectively
   -  Changed options and command-line arguments for SNESFAS to be in
      line with PCMG
   -  Added quasi-Newton (SNESQN), Nonlinear GMRES (SNESNGMRES),
      nonlinear conjugate gradients (SNESNCG), and multi-stage methods
      (SNESMS, used as a smoother for nonlinear multigrid).
   -  Support for Full Approximation Scheme nonlinear multigrid
      (SNESFAS) moved from DMMG to SNES and made composable with the
      methods above.
   -  SNES line search type should be set by name with
      SNESLineSearchSetType rather than with SNESLineSearchSet, see
      below.

   .. rubric:: SNESLineSearch:

   -  SNESLineSearch object added
   -  The default SNESLineSearch of a SNES may be gotten with
      SNESGetSNESLineSearch(SNES snes, SNESLineSearch \*linesearch)
   -  The linesearch type may be set with SNESLineSearchSetType() or
      -snes_linesearch_type
   -  The line search (and pre and post checks) is applied using
      SNESLineSearchApply()
   -  Pre/Post-check methods may be set with
      SNESLineSearchSetPre/PostCheck()
   -  The previous steplength may be accessed through
      SNESLineSearchSetLambda()
   -  The damping parameter may be set through
      SNESLineSearchSetDamping() or -snes_linesearch_damping
   -  Success of the line search is determined using
      SNESLineSearchGetSuccess()
   -  Custom linesearches may be built through
      SNESLINESEARCHSHELL,("shell") or by registering a new linesearch
      type with SNESLineSearchRegisterDynamic()
   -  SNESLINESEARCHBT,("bt") replaces SNES_LS_CUBIC and
      SNES_LS_QUADRATIC, and order may be set with
      SNESLineSearchSetOrder() or -snes_linesearch_order
   -  SNESLINESEARCHBASIC,("basic") replaces SNES_LS_BASIC and
      SNES_LS_BASICNONORMS. Norms may be turned off with
      SNESLineSearchSetComputeNorms() or -snes_linesearch_norms 0
   -  SNESLineSearchSetTolerances() replaces SNESLSSetParams(), with the
      former alpha parameter set with SNESLineSearchBTSetAlpha() or
      -snes_linesearch_alpha
   -  Added Line Search type SNESLINESEARCHL2,("l2") as the default for
      NRICHARDSON
   -  SNESLINESEARCHCP,("cp") added as the default line search method
      for SNESNCG and SNESQN

   .. rubric:: TS:

   -  -ts_max_time changed to -ts_final_time
   -  TSDefaultComputeJacobian() and TSDefaultComputeJacobianColor()
      have been removed. Configure TS to use coloring with
      SNESSetJacobian().
   -  Added TSROSW for Rosenbrock-W methods.
   -  Added a common, extensible system for adaptive controllers, see
      TSGetAdapt().

   .. rubric:: DM/DA:

   -  Added DMCreateDecomposition(DM,PetscInt,char*[]*,IS[]*,DM[]*) for
      use with PCFIELDSPLIT,PCASM,PCGASM
   -  Added DMCreateDecompositionDM(DM,const char*,DM*) to create a
      version of the DM encapsulating a named decomposition; use with
      DMCreateDecomposition()
   -  Added DMRedundant for managing globally coupled degrees of
      freedom.
   -  Removed DMCompositeAddArray(), use DMRedundantCreate() and
      DMCompositeAddDM().
   -  Renamed DMGetMatrix(), DMGetInterpolation(), DMGetInjection(), and
      DMGetColoring() to DMCreateMatrix(), etc for semantic consistency.
   -  The communicator argument to DMRefine() and DMCoarsen() can be
      MPI_COMM_NULL, but not PETSC_NULL, because the latter may not be
      the correct type.
   -  Added DMCoarsenHookAdd() and DMRefineHookAdd() for shepherding
      persistent resolution-dependent data between levels.
   -  Added DMGetNamedGlobalVector() for storing persistent
      resolution-dependent data.
   -  DMDASNESSetFunctionLocal() and DMDASNESSetJacobianLocal() can be
      used for convenient local evaluation; these routines will
      eventually replace DMDASetLocalFunction() and
      DMDASetLocalJacobian().

   .. rubric:: DMMG:

   -  DMMG is now completely removed from PETSc. Equivalent (and better)
      functionality can now be obtained by calling SNESSetDM() or
      KSPSetDM(). Make sure to avoid resolution-dependent data in the
      user context. Use SNESGetDM() or KSPGetDM() in the function
      evaluation context to obtain the grid. DMGetNamedGlobalVector(),
      DMCoarsenHookAdd(), and DMRefineHookAdd() can be used to manage
      persistent resolution-dependent data.

   .. rubric:: PetscViewer:

   -  A VTK binary viewer was added, see PETSCVIEWERVTK.

   .. rubric:: SYS:

   -  PetscBagLoad() now requires you previously created and registered
      all the records in the PETSc bag, allows loading on systems with
      different struct layout/endianness.
   -  PetscSF added as a type-generic graph communication mechanism. The
      current implementation requires MPI-2 one-sided and the interface
      is currently optional.

   .. rubric:: Fortran:

   -  PETSC_NULL_TRUTH is now PETSC_NULL_BOOL
   -  PetscOptionsGetEnum() now available from Fortran

   .. rubric:: `ExternalPackages <https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/miscellaneous/external.html>`__:

      integers.
   -  SuperLU_DIST interface updated to 3.1.
   -  SuperLU interface updated to 4.3.
   -  Sundials interface updated to 2.5.0.
   -  FFTW interface updated to 3.3.2.
   -  ParMetis updated to 4.0.2 and split from Metis 5.0.2 which is now
      separate.

   .. rubric:: Build:

   -  If Python 2.7 is available, the config/builder2.py is now
      available for a complete build, including dependency tracking.

   .. rubric:: Examples:

   -  SNES ex62 illustrates the use of DMComplex to solve the Stokes
      equation on an unstructured mesh. The Python tests show how to use
      block preconditioning strategies from the command line.
   -  SNES ex52 illustrates the use of CUDA for FEM integration
