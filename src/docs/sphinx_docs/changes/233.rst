Changes: 2.3.3

   .. rubric:: General:

   -  PetscInitialize() will now also check for options in .petscrc
      unless -skip_petscrc is used (note that since the file options are
      checked before the command line you cannot pass -skip_petscrc on
      the command line it must be passed in the file passed into
      PetscInitialize().
   -  When a filename is passed into PetscInitialize() ~/.petscrc and
      .petscrc are checked ALSO (they used to be skipped when a filename
      was passed in) unless -skip_petscrc is passed in the input file
   -  PetscMapInitialize() has been split into PetscMapInitialize() that
      is called before the Map is ever used and then PetscMapSetUp()
      which is called after the blocksize and local or global size is
      set and determines the ranges etc.

      which is called after the blocksize and local or global size is

   -  Changed the use of mpirun throughout the source to mpiexec; this
      includes petscmpirun -> petscmpiexec. Of course, PETSc will still
      work fine with MPI implementations that use mpirun.
   -  Add fortran interface to PetscBag routines

   .. rubric:: config/configure.py:

   -  F90 interface is now enabled by default [if the compiler is
      detected to be a f90 compiler]. i.e --with-f90-interface options
      is not required. The f90 interface impl used is a new universal
      one. However if you wish to use the old compiler specific one,
      then specify --with-f90-interface=nof90src [for configure to
      autodetect] or specify the appropriate one - like:
      --with-f90-interface=intel8

   .. rubric:: IS:

   -  changed IS_COLORING_LOCAL to IS_COLORING_GLOBAL

   .. rubric:: Vec:

   .. rubric:: VecScatter:

   -  Change prototype for VecScatterBegin() and VecScatterEnd() [now
      the first argument is VecScatter]

   .. rubric:: Mat:

   -  moved most of SNESMF implementation into mat/impls/mffd
   -  MatMFFD is now a regular matrix type registered in
      MatRegisterAll()
   -  changed SNESMF to MFFD for all previous SNESMF routines, except
      MatCreateSNESMF()
   -  -snes_mf_option changed to -mat_mffd_option except for -snes_mf
      and -snes_mf_operator
   -  SNES_KSP_EW... changed to SNESKSPWE... and SNES_KSP_EW_ConvCtx to
      SNESKSPEW
   -  MatGetRowIJ(), MatGetColumnIJ(), MatRestoreRowIJ(),
      MatRestoreColumnIJ() now take an extra argument

   .. rubric:: PC:

   -  changed PCMGSetCycles() and PCMGSetCyclesOnLevel() to
      PCMGSetCycleType() and PCMGSetCycleTypeOnLevel() that take a
      PCMGCycleType as argument and changed -pc_mg_cycle_type 1 or 2 to
      -pc_mg_cycles v or w
   -  added PCMGMultiplicativeSetCycles() and
      -pc_mg_multiplicative_cycles
   -  PCMGSetInterpolate() --> PCMGSetInterpolation()
   -  added PCREDUNDANT type, PCRedundantSetNumber() and
      -pc_redundant_number

   .. rubric:: KSP:

   -  Changed KSPNormTypes to have consistant naming , i.e

      -  KSP_NO_NORM -> KSP_NORM_NO
      -  KSP_PRECONDITIONED_NORM -> KSP_NORM_PRECONDITIONED
      -  KSP_UNPRECONDITIONED_NORM -> KSP_NORM_UNPRECONDITIONED
      -  KSP_NATURAL_NORM -> KSP_NORM_NATURAL

   -  The following function names are changed to be consistant:

      -  KSPSetMonitor -> KSPMonitorSet
      -  KSPClearMonitor -> KSPMonitorCancel
      -  KSPSingularValueMonitor -> KSPMonitorSingularValue
      -  KSPDefaultMonitor -> KSPMonitorDefault
      -  KSPTrueMonitor -> KSPMonitorTrueResidualNorm
      -  KSPDefaultSMonitor -> KSPMonitorDefaultShort
      -  KSPVecViewMonitor -> KSPMonitorSolution
      -  KSPGMRESKrylovMonitor -> KSPGMRESMonitorKrylov
      -  KSPLGMonitorCreate -> KSPMonitorLGCreate
      -  KSPLGMonitor -> KSPMonitorLG
      -  KSPLGMonitorDestroy -> KSPMonitorLGDestroy
      -  KSPLGTrueMonitorCreate -> KSPMonitorLGTrueResidualNormCreate
      -  KSPLGTrueMonitor -> KSPMonitorLGTrueResidualNorm
      -  KSPLGTrueMonitorDestroy -> KSPMonitorLGTrueResidualNormDestroy

   -  Following names are changed

      -  KSP_CONVERGED_STCG_NEG_CURVE -> KSP_CONVERGED_CG_NEG_CURVE
      -  KSP_CONVERGED_STCG_CONSTRAINED -> KSP_CONVERGED_CG_CONSTRAINED

   .. rubric:: SNES:

   .. rubric:: TS:

   -  TSSetRHSMatrix() and TSSetLHSMatrix() were replaced by
      TSSetMatrices()
   -  TSGetRHSMatrix() was replaced by TSGetMatrices()

   .. rubric:: DA:

   .. rubric:: DMMG:

   .. rubric:: SYS:

   .. rubric:: AO:

   -  AOData object and corresponding functionality is now removed for
      PETSc

   .. rubric:: Sieve:

   -  Added support for 2D and 3D mesh generation and refinement
   -  Added support for mesh partitioning and distribution
   -  Added support for partitioning based upon arbitrary dimensional
      entities, e.g. vertices, faces, etc.
   -  Added support for FIAT element generation
   -  Added support for higher order elements
   -  Added Poisson problem example in separate repository

   .. rubric:: Fortran:

   .. rubric:: `ExternalPackages <https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/miscellaneous/external.html>`__:

   -  Hypre interface is updated to use version 2.0.0
   -  Mumps interface is updated to use version 4.7.3
   -  fftw interface is updated to use v3.2alpha2
