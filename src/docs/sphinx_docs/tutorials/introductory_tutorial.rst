  This is work in progress. If you would like to help contribute to complete these
  introductory tutorials, please be in touch via `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc>`__
  or ``petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov``

These tutorials are intended for people new to PETSc, who would like to get oriented
by walking through how to use PETSc to perform some fundamental operations.

You should be able to complete this short set of tutorials in a couple of
of hours. This can be done on your own, or as part of a larger workshop on PETSc.

(Tutorials will be listed here as they are completed)

=============
These tutorials are not intended to cover all possible topics, but rather
to provide a gateway to the rest of the documentation.

In particular, see the :doc:`../../guides/guide_to_examples` which highlights some of the
large number of tutorial examples included with PETSc.
