KSP Object: (elas_) 1 MPI process
  type: gmres
    restart=30, using Classical (unmodified) Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization with no iterative refinement
    happy breakdown tolerance 1e-30
  maximum iterations=10000, initial guess is zero
  tolerances:  relative=0.005, absolute=1e-50, divergence=10000.
  left preconditioning
  using PRECONDITIONED norm type for convergence test
