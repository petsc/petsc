PETSc configure
   Get version for mpcc_r, mpCC_r, mpxlf_r, absoft F90, intel F90 (ifc and ifort), compaq F90

   Strip newlines from version for PG F90, Intel C/C++

   Test support for requesting 32 bit or 64 bit code

   Fix the bmake and configure way of handling -rpath paths for different compilers. How to do??

   It would be nice if someday configure could get the "compute nodes" to see
   that they have the appropriate shared libraries that are used when compiling
   or otherwise the static libraries are used.

   Do more error checking on user input arguments for nice error messages like if they
   pass a directory for -with-blas-lapack-dir or the other way around

   Change bmake/configure to only do one of C or C++ compiler?

KSP
   Manual pages for KSPConvergedReason

     Add option to KSP to generate error when convergence fails, rather than continuing with ConvergedReason
     Take out calls to SETERRQ directly in KSP solvers and replace with correct ConvergedReason
   

SNES
   Manual pages for SNESConvergedReason

   Add option to SNES to generate error when convergence fails, rather than continuing with ConvergedReason

   Add _SNESOps function table, dang I can't beleive we don't have it yet

Vectors
   Remove VecLoadIntoVector() and change VecLoad() to take a Vec as input

   Handle special cases of VecAXPBY
Error handling
   Add troubleshooting entries and error messages with web address for common errors.

PC/Mat
  Convert the Tufo-Fischer parallel direct solver to its own PC.

  Manual pages for partitioners

  Add support for ICC for BAIJ by converting to SBAIJ

  Add MatOption POSITIVE_DEFINITE and have KSP default to CG if that plus symmetric set

  Matrix impls should not use MatGetRow() on their own data structures, they should directly address the data structure.

  MatGetRow/ColumnIJ should have const for arrays that are returned

DMMG

   Add manual pages for DMMGGet....

General

  replace 1 in calls to SETERRQ**() with appropriate error code

  Make --download-mpich get the correct mpich under windows

  add DAVecGatherAll and DAVecGather
  
  keywords in maual pages should get listed in help topic list
